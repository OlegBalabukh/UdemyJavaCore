 * abstract class vs interface
 * -- abstract class as a class implements fundamental identity of all the child classes
 * -- a class can implement many interfaces, but it only can have one parent class
 * -- so it can have only one abstract class in the hierarchy
 * -- you only going to be able to extend one abstract class, but you can implement many interfaces
 * -- parent class determines what your child class is\
 * -- implementing an interface just determines one thing that it does, but through many interfaces a class can do many things
 * -- you cannot have code in an interface (all implementations completely up to the child class) but in an abstract class you can
 *    provide default functionality
